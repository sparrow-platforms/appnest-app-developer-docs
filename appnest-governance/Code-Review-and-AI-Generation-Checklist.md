# Code Review and AI Generation Checklist

**Before considering a change complete, verify every item below.** Use this document for code review and when validating AI-generated code.

It also defines **external API standards** for Appnest apps (outbound HTTP via **`$fetch`**). Read **External API** before building integrations; use the **full checklist** sections before merge or release.

---

## External API

Normative standards for calling external services from backend handlers.

### Standards

1. **Idempotency** — External push operations must prevent duplicates.
2. **Error handling** — Non-200 responses must be handled explicitly.
3. **Rate limiting** — 429 responses must be retried with backoff.
4. **Retry safety** — Retries must not cause duplicate resource creation.
5. **Secrets** — Credentials must use **installation_params** (e.g. `product_api_key`, secure text) or **oauth_config**. Hardcoding secrets is prohibited.

### Verify

- [ ] Idempotency implemented for external pushes  
- [ ] Non-200 responses handled explicitly  
- [ ] 429 / rate limits handled (backoff where appropriate)  
- [ ] Retries are safe (no duplicate side effects)  
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets — only **installation_params** or **oauth_config**  

---

## Runtime Safety

- [ ] Batching implemented for large datasets  
- [ ] $schedule used for long-running flows  
- [ ] $db used for state persistence  
- [ ] No unbounded loops  

---

## SDK Compliance

- [ ] No direct HTTP libraries (use `$fetch.request`)  
- [ ] Handlers exported from **app-backend/server.js** only  
- [ ] ResultData or structured return used  

---

## Manifest

- [ ] **event_listener_functions** and **backend_api_functions** match exports from app-backend/server.js  
- [ ] **oauth_config** declared if OAuth is used  
- [ ] **frontend_locations** (e.g. full_page_app.url) set correctly  

---

## Entry Points

- [ ] Frontend entry: **app-frontend/src/App.jsx**  
- [ ] Backend entry: **app-backend/server.js** (only exported functions are invokable)  

---

## Frontend UI (Twigs) — required when the app has a UI

- [ ] **`@sparrowengg/twigs-react`** and **`@sparrowengg/twigs-react-icons`** are listed in **`app-frontend/package.json`** (required app dependencies). Version should be **`"*"`** (latest)—do not pin to a specific version that may not exist (e.g. `^2.0.0`); see [Twigs-UI-Reference.md](Twigs-UI-Reference.md).  
- [ ] **All screens** use **only** Twigs (and twigs-react-icons) for buttons, form controls, layout, and feedback. No raw `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<table>`, `<label>`, `<p>` for UI—use Twigs **Button**, **Select**, **Input**, **Table**, **Text**, **Alert**, **Spinner**, etc.  
- [ ] **Layout and spacing** use Twigs layout components (**Stack**, **Box**) and their props (`gap`, `padding`); custom CSS is minimal and does **not** redefine buttons, alerts, or layout (no parallel design system like `.btn`, `.alert-error`).  
- [ ] **Loading, empty, and error states** use Twigs components (e.g. **Text**, **Spinner**, **Alert**) where applicable—not raw HTML or custom CSS-only divs.  
- [ ] No reliance on custom App.css classes (e.g. `.btn`, `.alert`, `.run-list`) when Twigs provides equivalent components; the app must look like a single Twigs-based design.  
- [ ] **Responsive:** UI uses **responsive** layout (Twigs responsive props/patterns) so the app works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile; no fixed widths that break on small screens.  
- [ ] **SaaS “wow” UI:** The app is viewed **inside a SaaS product** and delivers a **polished, professional** look and feel—clear hierarchy, readable typography, coherent spacing—so it feels native to the host and meets the quality users expect from a modern SaaS app.  
- [ ] Before considering frontend complete, confirm every screen uses Twigs only, layout uses Stack/Box, UI is responsive, and the experience is polished for a SaaS context. See [App-Frontend-Rules.md](App-Frontend-Rules.md) (full rules and section 18 checklist) and [Twigs-UI-Reference.md](Twigs-UI-Reference.md) (mapping table).
